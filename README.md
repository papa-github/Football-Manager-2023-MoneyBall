# Football-Manager-2023-MoneyBall
An adaptation of Alex030 and Zealand's Moneyball Google Sheet into Microsoft Excel

## Instructions
- Place 'Zealand's Moneyball V1.fmf' file in Football Manager 2023/views folder
- Switch to the above view in player search
- Ctrl+A to select all players found in player search (All players should become highlighted after a short pause)
- Ctrl+P to print, select Web File, save this file where it can be easily accessed
- Open the Moneyball Excel File
- In the 'Import' sheet, click the 'Import HTML' button on the bottom left and select the saved HTML File
- The sheet should automatically load the players in and switch you to the Search sheet
- Use the 'Search' sheet (and only this sheet) to analyse your shortlisted players!
- If you need to import another sheet, press the 'Import HTML' button again.

- Feel free to get in touch if you find any bugs (the excel file is pretty finicky)
